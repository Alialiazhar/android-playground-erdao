= Introduction =
PhotSpot is a GoogleMaps and public geotagged photo content mashup app to discover popular places.
It clusteres the geo information and show them on the map as balloon marker.
Clustering the marker is essential for application those want to manage many geotagged content on the screen, though displaying all the markers makes UI slow and let user hard to see the information.

= TODO List =
I am not sure if I would really implement below functions:
  * Time based filtering of the photo content
  * Data filtering and/or categorization for the spots
    * food/people/buildings/pets/animals...?
  * Route based search
    Not only based on location, letting user find what is on their way
  * use k-means for clustering
    make k=10 to get top-10 spots?
  * Invoke Radar?
  * Spots Sharing function(e-mail?)
  * Store Favorite db to SD?
  * Enrich Gallery UI?
