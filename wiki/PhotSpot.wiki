= Introduction =
PhotSpot is a GoogleMaps and public geotagged photo content mashup app to discover popular places.
It clusteres the geo information and show them on the map as balloon marker.
Clustering the marker is essential for application those want to manage many geotagged content on the screen, though displaying all the markers makes UI slow and let user hard to see the information.

= Tricks and Issues =
For clustering, ported javascript version of [http://code.google.com/p/gmaps-utility-library/ markerclusterer] to java code.
There are other things in android SDK1.5r3 does not support and needed to tweak a bit.
  * Map move/zoom event handling
  In javascript version of google maps, it can register event handler such as "moveend" and "zoomend" but not in android. for that I needed to hook the draw event of the marker to check the current screen projection (bounds) to know if it is moving or staying still.
  * ItemizedOverlay are easy but not customizable well enough
  there are plenty sample sources use ItemizedOverlay but I don't think this class is useful if you need to do many things with markers.
  * Built-in zoom control can't hook events
  built-in zoom control are easy but can't hook press event, as well it only zoom to center of current screen so sometime marker in focus will get out of bounds. For that, I needed to implement zoom control as button and zoom manually.
  * Can't set zoom level directly
  apis given is ZoomIn or ZoomOut only zooming one level at a time, can't set directly to maximum zoom level.
